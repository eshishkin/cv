Profile: | 
    <p>My name is Eugene. I am a software developer with 10+ years of experience. 
    Though I have been working in the same company for several years, I have a lot of different projects done. 
    Mostly I use Java language, but tried JS/Python in my side projects.</p>

    <br/>

    <p>Apart from programming I am interested in DevOps and IT management. 
    As for hobbies - I like astronomy (I have 10 inch dobsonian), photography and hiking.
    I always try to learn something new everyday.</p>
