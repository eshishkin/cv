title: About Me
---

Hello! My name is **Eugene Shishkin**. I am a software developer with **14+ years** of experience.
Though I have been working in the same company for several years, due to the nature of outstaffing I have a lot of different projects done.
There is wide range of project in my portfolio: projects for local printing house as well as fintech for big Russian bank.

Mostly I use **Java** and **Spring/Spring Boot** since it's a common stack for **backend** development. 
For pet projects I prefer Python as it's less wordy. Actively diving into IT management and AI.


As for hobbies - I like 
- Astronomy (I have 10 inch dobsonian)
- Photography
- Travelling, living in a tent and hiking
